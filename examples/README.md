# ðŸŽ‰ LangChain.go Examples

This directory contains a collection of example projects demonstrating various features and integrations of LangChain.go, a powerful library for building applications with large language models (LLMs).

## Contents

The examples cover a wide range of topics, including:

- LLM integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Ollama, etc.)
- Chains and agents
- Vector stores and embeddings
- Prompt engineering
- Memory and conversation management
- Database integrations
- And more!

Each example is contained in its own subdirectory with a descriptive name, making it easy to find and explore specific use cases.

## Running the Examples

To run an example:

1. Navigate to the desired example directory
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (usually by running `go mod tidy`)
3. Set any required environment variables (e.g., API keys)
4. Run the example with `go run .`

## Key Examples

Some notable examples include:

- `openai-chat-example`: Demonstrates basic chat functionality with OpenAI's GPT models
- `mrkl-agent-example`: Shows how to create an agent that can use tools to solve complex tasks
- `chroma-vectorstore-example`: Illustrates using Chroma as a vector store for similarity search
- `sql-database-chain-example`: Showcases querying SQL databases using natural language
