# Quickstart: LangChainGo with Ollama

Get started with running your first program using LangChainGo and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/). Ollama provides the most straightforward method for local LLM inference across all computer platforms.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Ollama**: [Download and install Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
2. **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Steps

1. **Initialize Ollama**: In your terminal, execute the command `$ ollama run llama2`. The first run might take some time as the model needs to be fetched to your computer.
2. **Run the Example**: Enter the command:
   ```shell
   go run github.com/tmc/langchaingo/examples/ollama-completion-example@main
   ```

You should receive (something like) the following output:

```shell
The first human to set foot on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut, who stepped onto the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969.
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and executed your first open-source LLM-based program using local inference.

Here is the entire program (from [ollama-chat-example](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo/blob/main/examples/ollama-chat-example/ollama_chat_example.go)).

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/ollama"
	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/schema"
)

func main() {
	llm, err := ollama.NewChat(ollama.WithLLMOptions(ollama.WithModel("llama2")))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	ctx := context.Background()
	completion, err := llm.Call(ctx, []schema.ChatMessage{
		schema.SystemChatMessage{Content: "Give a precise answer to the question based on the context. Don't be verbose."},
		schema.HumanChatMessage{Content: "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks? Give me 3 examples."},
	}, llms.WithStreamingFunc(func(ctx context.Context, chunk []byte) error {
		fmt.Print(string(chunk))
		return nil
	}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(completion)
}
```
