# Models

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/models/)
:::

Models are a core component of LangChain. LangChain is not a provider of models, but rather provides a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of language models.
LangChain provides support for both text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Chat Models, and Text Embedding models.

LLMs use a text-based input and output, while Chat Models use a message-based input and output.

> **_Note:_** Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions. If you have any feedback, please let us know!
