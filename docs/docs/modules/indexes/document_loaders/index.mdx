# Getting Started: Document Loaders

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/indexing/document-loaders)
:::

Document loaders make it easy to create [Documents](../../schema/document.md) from a variety of sources. These documents can then be loaded onto [Vector Stores](../vector_stores/) to load documents from a source.

## All Document Loaders

<DocCardList />

## Advanced

If you want to implement your own Document Loader, you must create a struct that implement the document loader interface.
