# Getting Started: Vector Stores

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/indexing/vectorstore)
:::

A vector store is a particular type of database optimized for storing documents and their [embeddings](../../models/embeddings/), and then fetching of the most relevant documents for a particular query, ie. those whose embeddings are most similar to the embedding of the query.

```typescript
interface VectorStore {
  /**
   * Add more documents to an existing VectorStore
   */
  addDocuments(documents: Document[]): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Search for the most similar documents to a query
   */
  similaritySearch(
    query: string,
    k?: number,
    filter?: object | undefined
  ): Promise<Document[]>;

  /**
   * Search for the most similar documents to a query,
   * and return their similarity score
   */
  similaritySearchWithScore(
    query: string,
    k = 4,
    filter: object | undefined = undefined
  ): Promise<[object, number][]>;

  /**
   * Turn a VectorStore into a Retriever
   */
  asRetriever(k?: number): BaseRetriever;

  /**
   * Advanced: Add more documents to an existing VectorStore,
   * when you already have their embeddings
   */
  addVectors(vectors: number[][], documents: Document[]): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Advanced: Search for the most similar documents to a query,
   * when you already have the embedding of the query
   */
  similaritySearchVectorWithScore(
    query: number[],
    k: number,
    filter?: object
  ): Promise<[Document, number][]>;
}
```

You can create a vector store from a list of [Documents](../../schema/document), or from a list of texts and their corresponding metadata. You can also create a vector store from an existing index, the signature of this method depends on the vector store you're using, check the documentation of the vector store you're interested in.

```typescript
abstract class BaseVectorStore implements VectorStore {
  static fromTexts(
    texts: string[],
    metadatas: object[] | object,
    embeddings: Embeddings,
    dbConfig: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<VectorStore>;

  static fromDocuments(
    docs: Document[],
    embeddings: Embeddings,
    dbConfig: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<VectorStore>;
}
```
