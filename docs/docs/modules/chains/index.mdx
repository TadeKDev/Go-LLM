# Getting Started: Chains

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains)
:::info

Using a language model in isolation is fine for some applications, but it is often useful to combine language models with other sources of information, third-party APIs, or even other language models. This is where the concept of a chain comes in.

LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, as well as a number of built-in chains that can be used out of the box. You can also create your own chains.

## Running chains

## Advanced

To implement your own custom chain you must create an struct that implements the chain interface.
